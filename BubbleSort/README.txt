When ran, the code will provide instructions for using the program,
If you are using powershell, simply enter "Java --enable-preview -jar BubbleSort.jar" and it should work
In case jar file doesn't work use java file and inform me
MANIFEST.MF file is needed for powershell
text files should not be necessary as the program should create the files

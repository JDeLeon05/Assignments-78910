If you are using powershell, simply enter "Java --enable-preview -jar BubbleSort.jar" and it should work
Function is computed as an f(n) sequence, simply enter the command and after it the number of terms you'd like for the sequence
for example, if you wanted to know the 3rd term(or f(3)), simply enter "3" after BubbleSort.jar in the command line
In case jar file doesn't work use java file and inform me
MANIFEST.MF file is needed for powershell
